# ABM
This repo contains code for a basic Agent Based Model of an Emergency Room.  Agents present in this model include Patients, Nurses (triage only) and Doctors.  

A simulation can be run as follows:
```
python abm.py --n_patients 100 --n_triage_nurses 3 --n_doctors 4 --ticks 720 --alternate 3
```
